## Pricing Service Code

You can locate the code microservice  pricing service in the `pricing-service` folder. It functions as a REST WebService that emulates a backend for storing andmicroservicethe price of a specified vehicle. In the project, you'll convert it into a microservice registered through a Eureka server.

Let's briefly inspect the included files, of which you'll only need to implement certain ones. Note that every package is within `com.udacity`.

`pricing`

### PricingServiceApplication
This initializes the Pricing Service as a Spring Boot application.

`pricing.api`

### PricingController
This serves as the actual REST controller for the application. It determines the response to a GET request, which in this case, is a randomly generated price obtained from the `PricingService`. Once converted into a microservice, the Controller may not be explicitly required.

`pricing.domain.price`

### Price
This defines the Price class, primarily consisting of private variables currency, price, and vehicleId.

### PriceRepository
This repository provides a form of data persistence while the web service is operational, specifically the pairing of ID to price generated by the `PricingService`.

`pricing.service`

### PriceException
This creates a `PriceException` that can be thrown when an issue arises in the `PricingService`.

### PricingService
The Pricing Service carries out the bulk of the code's operations. Here, it establishes a mapping of random prices to IDs, along with the method for generating these random prices. Once transformed into a microservice, the Service may not be explicitly required.
