P02-VehiclesAPI Project: This folder contains the instructions that were followed to build the project correctly.


### Project Overview

In this project, you'll utilize your skills in Spring Boot, APIs, documentation, and testing to create a *Vehicles API*. This API will serve as a centralized endpoint for managing vehicle inventory. The main functionality of the Vehicles API involves performing [CRUD operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) for vehicle details such as make, model, and color. Additionally, it will integrate with other APIs to gather location and pricing information. Your tasks include developing a RESTful API for the Vehicles module and transforming a Pricing Service API into a microservice.

That application is capable of seamless communication with external services. Furthermore, the application will feature Swagger-based API documentation for easy viewing and usage.

Throughout this guide, we'll provide a concise overview of the code for each application component involved in the project. Subsequently, we'll detail the instructions for executing the project. If you prefer, you can skip the code overview sections and proceed directly to the project instructions. Access the project code from the Github repository and navigate to the **P02-VehiclesAPI folder** for reference.
